  <h2>Malware</h2>
  <p>Malware (malicious software) is software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. Malware does the damage after it is implanted or introduced in some way into a persons computer.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
  <p>Below is a list of the most common types of malware.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Viruses:</b> A computer virus modifies legitimate host files (or pointers to them) in such a way that when a victim's file is executed, the virus is also executed</li>
    <li><b>Worms:</b> A worm is self-replicating and can spread quickly by exploiting other files and programs to do the dirty work.</li>
    <li><b>Trojans:</b> Trojans masquerade as legitimate programs, but they contain malicious instructions.</li>
    <li><b>Ransomeware:</b> Ransomeware encrypts your data and holds it hostage waiting for a payoff</li>
    <li><b>Adware:</b> Adware attempts to expose the compromised end-user to unwanted, potentially malicious advertising</li>
    <li><b>Malvertising:</b> Not to be confused with adware, malvertising is the use of legitimate ads or ad networks to covertly deliver malware to unsuspecting users' computers</li>
    <li><b>Spyware:</b> Spyware is most often hidden within programs. It will send your activity to another place to be processed. An example could be TikTok.</li>
    <li><b>Hybrids and Exotic Forms:</b> Today, most malware is a combination of traditional malicious programs, often including parts of Trojans and worms and occasionaly a virus.</li>
