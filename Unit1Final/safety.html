  <h1>Health &amp; Safety</h1>
  <p>The long-term use of computers has been linked to a range of potential health problems, or <em>computing related disorders</em> (CRDs). The following list outlines some of the potential health risks</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - </b>CTS is a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints, especially the wrist.</li>
    <li><b>Computer Vision Syndrome - </b>Frequent computer users can suffer from computer vision syndrome, resulting in reduced eyesight (Myopia), blurred vision, dry eyes, overall eye tiredness and even Glaucoma</li>
    <li><b>Musculoskeletal Problems - </b>Back and posture problems caused by the user being crouched and hunched towards the monitor.</li>
    <li><b>Sleep Disorders - </b>The light from your computer and phone screens affects melatonin production and prevents deep, restorative sleep resulting in an increase in stress, sleep disorders and depression in young adults</li>
    <li><b>Mental Problems - </b>Studies have shown that children who spend too long on the internet face social problems such as lonlieness, depression and anxiety</li>
  </ul>
