    <p class="paragraph">I don't have many hobbies. One of the few I do have is working with computers. Hence why I made this "slide show" in HTML. I like building computers, working with parts of computers, troubleshooting issues, and manipulating computers to do what I need them to.  </p>
    <p class="paragraph">I also do a lot of gaming. Specifically, VR gaming. I play a lot of Zenith: The Last City and OrbusVR: Reborn. I sprinkle some "pancake" gaming in tp but it's mainly VR gaming right now. I am either using my Oculus Quest 2 or my Valve Index. It depends on what I'm doing that day</p>
