    <h2>Hard Drive</h2>
    <p>Hard drives are your mass storage devices. These store large ammounts of data for really, anything to reference at any time. Hard drives are persistent meaning they keep data even after a power cycle. Hard drives come in 2 common formats. Hard Disk and Solid State. Hard disk is optical based and uses lasers and disks to write data. Solid state drives use flash to store data. HDDs are usually slower but are also cheaper and hold more data. SSDs will be faster but are also more expensive and can't hold <em>as much</em> data as an HDD</p>
