  <h1>Lady Gaga announces Joanne world tour after show-stopping Super Bowl halftime show</h1>

  <p>Following her massive halftime show at Sunday's Super Bowl, Lady Gaga announced a just as massive world tour to back her fifth studio album, Joanne. The tour kicks off in Vancouver in August, before hitting the rest of North America in August and September, followed by dates across Europe and a final U.S. run to wrap it up.<br><br>
    Gaga previously headlined the <em>Fame Ball Tour</em> (2009), the <em>Monster Ball Tour</em> (2009-2011), the <em>Born This Way Ball</em> (2012-2013), and <em>ArtRave: The ARTPOP Ball</em> in 2014. She also did a few dates with Tony Bennett for the Cheek to Cheek Tour (2014-2015).<br><br>
    Just before releasing Joanne, which sold nearly 1 million units worldwide in just three months and has climbed to No. 1 on the iTunes charts as of Sunday night, the singer went on a three-date promotional Dive Bar Tour in October, performing smaller sets around the U.S. <br></p>
